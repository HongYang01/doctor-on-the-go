## 📋 Project Overview

**Aim**: Provide essential healthcare services to remote and rural communities in Malaysia through the implementation of a "Doctor-On-the-Go!" system. Our objectives include:

- Address issues like weather-related flight cancellations and limited healthcare access.
- Promote early disease detection and health awareness.
- Reduce unnecessary trips to local clinics or hospitals.
- Improve healthcare self-monitoring for villagers.

## ❓ Project Case Study

The Ministry of Health Malaysia provides two services to serve remote or rural communities, which are a flying doctor service and mobile clinics. For flying doctor service, the service is only offered in places with landing zones. There are 12 teams of Air Land force (Pasukan Darat Udara - PDU) in Sarawak that provide service to 159 areas. In 2006, the federal government paid an estimated RM 5,1,000,000 annually on Flying Doctors services in Sarawak alone. The doctor flying service is available once a month. However, due to frequent flight cancellations caused by weather conditions and technical difficulties, the village cannot be visited and the people must wait until the next month. It is not only inconvenient for the villagers, but also dangerous for patients such as pregnant women, children who require immunisation, and those who require ongoing care, such as Hypertension and Diabetes patients.

In rural areas, free health screenings will be provided via mobile clinics. This service is also an effort to address the issue of overcrowding in current health clinics, in addition to assisting the community in receiving health care at an early stage without having to travel to a distant clinic. The attempt to construct a mobile clinic is believed to be able to educate the community about the importance of health screenings for the early detection of diseases. As with diabetes, people who are made aware of their condition at an early stage are much more likely to take good care of their diet. The bus and the boat are the two transportation modes that are currently being used to provide the mobile clinic's services.

It is proposed that a Doctor-On-the-Go! system offer villagers with required healthcare services, increase self-monitoring, and decrease unnecessary trips to the nearby local clinics or hospital.
